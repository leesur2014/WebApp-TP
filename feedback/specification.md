Project Specification Feedback
==================

Commit graded:

### The product backlog (10/10)

The product backlog is detailed and complete. You should break the Drawing Game Implemenntation Task into small subtasks and assign each into a single person. Two minor advice: 1) present the backlog using spreadsheet. It is easy to track and will help you follow to update of the requirements; 2) estimate the cost of each task. That will help you split the task equally, also track the total progress.

### Data models (10/10)

For now, your data model is pretty simple and clear. The relationship of main models are correct. We expect you to provide more detailed mapping between your model and the wireframe you provide. For example, there might be several games in a single room so probably, you need a Game model in the middle of Round and Room.

### Wireframes or mock-ups (10/10)

The wireframes are pretty clean and easy to understand in general. As we expected, the webapp includes a lot of interactions with the user, so probably in the actual design, a more detailed prototype should be made.
