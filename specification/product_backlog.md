### Login/logout via Facebook

    A user could login through Facebook's verification page. 
    Whenever a user accesses our home page, an alert 
    window "continue with Facebook" would redirect them to login 
    with their Facebook account.
    After a user is logged in, he/she would see a game center 
    page which displays all public game rooms. In this page, 
    Similarly, the user could logout during any time and be 
    redirected back to the home page.
    
### Game Center
    
    a) a user could join a publicly listed game room (as a 
        player or observer).
    b) a user could join a private room by entering invite code
        (as a player or observer).
    c) a user could create room (could be public/private), if the
    room is private, this user would get a room inviting passcode.
    
### Drawing Room
    
    
    After all players click "ready", the game starts. Any player
    who hasn't "ready"ed for 20 seconds after all other players are 
    "ready" could be deducted some points and be made an observer.
    
    There could be 2 types of users in a drawing room.
    a) player: each player take turns to be a "drawer" who could see a keyword
    and draw any shape on the board. The first 2 players who guessed 
    right keyword are winners (for some points). If nobody guessed
    right, the drawer could be deducted some points.
    
    b) observer: an observer could only watch the game and give
    remarks.
